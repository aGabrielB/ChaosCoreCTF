Description : 
Second installment of ChaosCoreCTF bringing 30 maps constructed around 3v3 & 4v4 competitive play,
However not all maps are built for 3v3 & 4v4 competitive play; Most have been adjusted to these standards.
ChaosCoreCTF acts as a stand alone wad and can be loaded with other wads without overwriting any maps or resources as a means to provide more content in Public and Private CTF.

Additional Credits:

Also another honorable mention for Fsn76 for the trailer
